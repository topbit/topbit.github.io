<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
<p>Topbit.  A name I gave myself in September 1996 - if not a little before - when I first went onto the internet, and then created my first kink-related website on Geocities. As this part of my persona, I've only had one, quite small website before - which in the space of a year morphed into an adult pay-site. That was more than five years ago though, and it's time for another place where I can put up my thoughts that may not fully fit into my livejournal. </p>

<h3>Participation</h3>
<p>I've designed this site to work in concert with my <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/topbit/">own livejournal</a> to enable others to give feedback to what is here.  Besides all the usual information about me, and links to items of interest I've also started a small archive of articles that I have written, and will add copies of websites that I've written - including the first kinky site that went up in November 1996 (if I can find a copy of it!) as well as the site(s) that it became over the next four years.</p>
