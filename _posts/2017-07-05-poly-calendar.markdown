#### Poly (Google)-Calendar links

In August 2008, just after I came home from Bicon in Glamorgan, I set up a couple of calendars and published the details on getting them on my livejournal. A few years ago, I had left them both fallow for some time, and so the Bisexual events calendar was re-created by Jen Yockney as part of her work at <http://bicommunitynews.co.uk/>. The calendar itself is at <http://bicommunitynews.co.uk/local-groups/>.

The Poly events calendar is still under my control, and I will add to it when I see a new one-off or regular event if I can, but I don't get many additions being sent to me, so I can't easily tell if events are still running, and what new events or meetings are happening.  

You can find al the links to various formats to get the calendar at <http://topbit.co.uk/poly-calendar>. Below is the HTML


To add new meetups, events, or to correct information that is currently on the calendar, let me know - email <mailto:calendar@topbit.co.uk> with dates/locations and any links to more information you think would be useful.
